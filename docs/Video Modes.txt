In order to increase boþ variety in software visuals and program speed, þe Spitfire™ Komodo™ has many video modes, defined by memory address 0x01000000.

RAW DATA MODES:
	MODE 00:
		Red-Green Dichrome mode. Þe high Byte of a Word is þe Red value, and þe low Byte is Green.
		Due to VRAM constraints, 2 pixels horizontally are controlled by each Memory address, leading to a total of 128×224 effective resolution.
		65536 colour limit, but quite slow to use in practice due to needing 7Mib of Memory being written.
	MODE 01:
		Red-Blue Dichrome mode. Þe high Byte of a Word is þe Red value, and þe low Byte is Blue.
		Due to VRAM constraints, 2 pixels horizontally are controlled by each Memory address, leading to a total of 128×224 effective resolution.
		65536 colour limit, but quite slow to use in practice due to needing 7Mib of Memory being written.
	MODE 02:
		Green-Blue Dichrome mode. Þe high Byte of a Word is þe Green value, and þe low Byte is Blue.
		Due to VRAM constraints, 2 pixels horizontally are controlled by each Memory address, leading to a total of 128×224 effective resolution.
		65536 colour limit, but quite slow to use in practice due to needing 7Mib of Memory being written.
	MODE 03:
		Black and White Monochome mode. Þe high Byte of a Word is þe Left pixel, and þe low Byte is þe Right pixel.
		Due to VRAM constraints, 2 pixels horizontally are controlled by each Memory address, but can have different shades, leading to a total of 256×224 resolution.
		256 colour limit in Black White, high resolution, but quite slow to use in practice due to needing 7Mib of Memory being written.
	MODE 04:
		Raw data paletted mode. Þe high Byte of a Word is þe Left pixel, and þe low Byte is þe Right pixel. In all paletted modes, þe first colour of palette 0 is #000000
		Due to VRAM constraints, 2 pixels horizontally are controlled by each Memory address, but can have different colours, leading to a total of 256×224 resolution.
		256 colour limit in 16 Bit colour, high resolution, but quite slow to use in practice due to needing >7Mib of Memory being written.
TILE/SPRITE MODES:
	MODE 04:
		Tile/Sprite mode. Colour palette 0 is split up into 16 subpalettes of 16 colours each and uses no palette switching. Uses Sprite Bank 0 at 16×16 resolution, giving a total of 1024 tiles.
		Tile Banks are used at 16x16 resolution, leading to a total of 1024 tiles/bank. Sprite data starts at 0x01008000 and is split into four groups and is stored as follows:
			0x01008000 - 0x01009FFF hvppppgg gggggggg
			0x0100A000 - 0x0100BFFF xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx
			0x0100C000 - 0x0100DFFF yyyyyyyy yyyyyyyy
			0x0100E000 - 0x0100FFFF 00000000 00000000
				h - horizontal flip
				v - vertical flip
				p - colour palette to use
				g - graphics
				x - x position
				y - y position
				0 - unused
		Memory address 0x01000200 controls what tile bank is used for rendering þe background. Tile bank 0 is always all Black. Tiles are from 0x01100000 to 0x0110FFFF, and are stored as follows:
			hvppppgg gggggggg
				h - horizontal flip
				v - vertical flip
				p - palette to use
				g - tile index
