Þe Unnamed Computer has 64MiB of accessable address space, laid out like so:
	memory
		0x00000000-0x0000FFFF - 0-page
		0x00000000-0x00FFFFFF - Working RAM
		0x01000000-0x017FFFFF - Video RAM
		0x01800000-0x01FDFFFF - Audio RAM
		0x01FE0000-0x01FEFFFF - High Stack
		0x01FF0000-0x01FFFFFF - Low Stack
		0x02000000-0x020000FF - Cartridge Swap Bank
		0x02000100-0x02FFFFFF - Cartridge Swap
		0x03000000-0x03FFFFFF - Cartridge Static

WORKING RAM:
	ÞE 0-PAGE:
		0-Page addresses typically are easier to access in more complex instrcution, needing only 1 Argument to specify þe memory address.
		Þere is no distinction between 0-Page and normal memory oþerwise.
	Working Ram stores variables, arrays, and oþer þings þat need to be remembered. Unlike oþer parts of parts of Address Space, it has no uses elsewhere, and can be altered wiþout changing system functions like video or audio.
VIDEO RAM:
	Quite complex, see VRAM.txt
AUDIO RAM:
	TODO
ÞE STACK:
	Þe Stack exists solely for stack based operations, such as subroutines, and has a register associated to it. All memory past þe stack height is considered uninitialised.
CARTRIDGE SPACE:
	CARTRIDGE SWAP:
		Cartridges have 2 parts, a Static part and a Swap part. þe swap part of þe cartridge acts like typical ram, but changing þe value at address "Swaps" þat part of þe cartridge for a different bank.
	CARTRIDGE STATIC:
		Þe swap part of þe cartridge is Read only, and can't be swapped out. Þe Program Counter starts at 0x03000000, at þe very start of Static space
